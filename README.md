Here's a template for your README file that outlines the steps to set up and run both the frontend and backend:

# DWLR Project

This project is designed to collect and analyze high-frequency water level readings from multiple sensors across various locations, detecting anomalies in water levels and battery status. The system consists of a React-based frontend and a Flask-based backend, built to display real-time data, predictions, and anomalies.

- [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints)
- [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.7 or later)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- Git

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dwlr-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd dwlr-project
   ```

---

## Running the Backend

The backend uses Flask to process data and serve predictions.

1. Navigate to the `DWLR-backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd DWLR-backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Flask backend:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Running the Frontend

The frontend is a React app that interacts with the backend to display sensor data and predictions.

1. Navigate to the `DWLR-frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../DWLR-frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/predict**: Accepts sensor data in JSON format and returns anomaly detection results based on water level and battery status.

Request example:

```json
{
  "sensorId": "s1",
  "location": "Vijayawada",
  "timestamp": "2024-09-28T15:30",
  "waterLevel": 12,
  "batteryLevel": 55
}
```

Response example:

```json
{
  "Sensor Id": "s1",
  "Timestamp": "28-09-2024",
  "Quarter": "Quarter 3",
  "Location": "Vijayawada",
  "Water Level": 12,
  "Battery Level": 55,
  "Status": "Normal"
}
```

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Database**: None (local data handling)
- **Version Control**: Git

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that both the frontend and backend are running concurrently for the project to work as expected.
- The backend should be running at `http://localhost:5000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
- If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have the correct versions of Node.js and Python installed.
